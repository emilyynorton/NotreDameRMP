Notre Dame Rate My Professor Path Extension

This Chrome extension reveals Rate My Professor information when a user hovers over a professor's name on Notre Dame's PATH class search page. The goal is that makes it easier for students to evaluate their class opions from the PATH page without having to navigate back and forth between PATH and Rate My Professor!

Note: The department feature is currently set to null, as the department categories in Rate My Professor are far more limited than the departments and attributes that Notre Dame uses to categorize professors on PATH. Most of the categories would not match without an extremely extensive dictionary, so matching is based on name similarity.
