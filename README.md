Notre Dame Rate My Professor Path Extension

This Chrome extension reveals Rate My Professor information when a user hovers over a professor's name on Notre Dame's PATH class search page. The goal is to make it easier for students to evaluate their class options within PATH. 

Thanks to Uttej Mannava for the inspiration!

Note: Matching is currently based on strict name similarity. The target department feature is implemented in the code, but set to null, as the department categories in Rate My Professor do not align with the attributes that Notre Dame uses to categorize professors on PATH. Most of the categories would not match without an extremely extensive dictionary and a standardized conversion between RMP and Notre Dame categories (for example, FTT students at Notre Dame could classify the same professor under "Film", "Fine Arts", "Art", "Design", and "Theater", making it difficult to use department as matching criteria).
