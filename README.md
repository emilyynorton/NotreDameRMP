Notre Dame Rate My Professor Path Extension

This Chrome extension reveals Rate My Professor information when a user hovers over a professor's name on Notre Dame's PATH class search page. The goal is that makes it easier for students to evaluate their class options from the PATH page without having to navigate back and forth between PATH and Rate My Professor!

Note: The target department feature is currently set to null, as the department categories in Rate My Professor do not align with the departments and attributes that Notre Dame uses to categorize professors on PATH. Most of the categories would not match without an extremely extensive dictionary and a standardized conversion between RMP and Notre Dame categories (for example, FTT students at Notre Dame classify the same professors under "Film", "Fine Arts", "Art", "Design", and "Theater", making it difficult to use department as matching criteria). 
    
Matching is currently based on strict name similarity.
